# Compute SRT svg
This is a process of concatenating spatialDE
## Work Flow
This process uses the method of finding SVG in spatialDE. 
For the specific reason and process, see [spatialDE](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4636)
## Requirements
This script runs based on python, and the required python packages are as followsï¼š
* argparse
* numpy
* pandas
* sys
* NaiveDE
* SpatialDE
* matplotlib
## Use the script
To use this script you can calculate an SVG of your own data, you need to provide 
a spatial expression matrix with ** row names for cell names, columns for gene names ** 
and a file with spatial location information 
1. Example of a spatial representation matrix: [Rep11_MOB_0.csv](https://github.com/gouxiaojuan/pipeline_spatialDE/blob/main/example/Rep11_MOB_0.csv)
2. Example of a file with spatial location information: [MOB_sample_info.csv](https://github.com/gouxiaojuan/pipeline_spatialDE/blob/main/example/MOB_sample_info.csv)
